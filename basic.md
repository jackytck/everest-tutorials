This Chapter introduces the fundamental development skill sets. You probably know most of them.  Before your start your work, make sure you are familiar with all of them.

# Workflow

A common work flow is:

1. Your mentor will assign a problem to you, and specify a git repository to write your code.
2. [Fork your mentor's repo](/git#Fork) to your own git account.
3. Clone the repo to your computer, [update the dependencies](/basic/dependency.md).
4. Start Coding with your favorite [editor](/basic/editor.md).
5. Make sure you are following the team's [coding style](/basic/style.md).
6. Write comprehensive comments and generate the [documentation](/basic/documentation.md).
7. [Write tests](/basic/test.md) for your code. Or if tests exist, make sure your code will pass.
8. Merge with your mentor's code, resolve conflicts if exists.
9. Commit and push the code to your repo.
10. Create a[ pull request](/basic/git.md) to submit your code.
