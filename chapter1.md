# Workflow

A common work flow is:

1. Your mentor will assign a problem to you. The problem comes with [a git repository](/chapter1/git.md) where you will write your code into.
2. [Fork your mentor's repo](/chapter1/git.md) to your own git account.
3. Clone down your git repo to your computer, install the dependencies.
