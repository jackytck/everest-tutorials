# Engine



`altizure-gl-engine`is a web-based 3D graphics engine. It provides interactive 3D contents for the [Altizure](https://www.altizure.com/) website, the [Altizure SDK](/3d/sdk.md) and the [Altizure Planet](/3d/planet.md).

### Altizure GL Engine

* Cross platform \(Win, IOS, Linux\), supports both desktop and mobile.
* High 3D loading efficiency. Terra-Byte 3D content display of thousands 3D scenes on earth: [Altizure Earth](https://site.altizure.com/earth).
* [Water reflection](https://altizure.github.io/sdk.examples/2-1-add-project-water/) and physical atmosphere.

### Threejs

Our engine is built on top of threejs [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/)

### Other earth viewers

* google earth
* [cecium](https://cesiumjs.org/)
* [webgl-earth](http://www.webglearth.org/)

### Upgrading

Engine is being upgraded to the next generation, which will be

* strictly memory-efficient proofed by using memory-leak test for every class.
* open material library interface
* use ancestor's texture to generate earth tile. to accelerate earth LOD
